# ðŸš¨ Accident & Disaster Detection Model using YOLOv11
This repository contains object detection models trained to detect **accidents** and **natural disasters** using YOLOv11. The system is part of a broader initiative to improve real-time disaster and accident response through automated monitoring of CCTV feeds. The model training includes detection for car collision, fire, flood, and landslide.

### ðŸ§  Model Descriptions
- **custom.pt**: A custom YOLOv11-based model trained on 18,753 labeled images across 5 classes (collision, fire, smoke, flood, landslide). Designed specifically for accident and disaster detection using CCTV footage.
- **yolov11n.pt**: A pre-trained YOLOv11 nano model trained on the COCO dataset. Lightweight and optimized for general-purpose object detection with high inference speed, but not tailored for disaster-specific scenarios.
